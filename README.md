# Social Media Scheduler

## The purpose of your application 
 I want to create a marketing tool that facilitates the planning, creation, scheduling, and tracking of social media posts across various platforms such as Discord, Facebook, and Instagram. I need support for different states for each post, such as draft, pending approval, and approved, and I want to create a list of platforms to associate each post with later.

## About your application
Based on the application intent, with Contember you will build a marketing tool that allows you to plan, create, schedule, and track social media posts across different platforms. You will be able to manage the state of each post (draft, pending approval, approved) and associate them with specific platforms. Contember will provide the necessary infrastructure, including a PostgreSQL database, a GraphQL API, built-in authentication, and a role-based access control list. You will also be able to extend the functionality with your own React.js components.
